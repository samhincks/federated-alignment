📡 Federated Alignment API
A minimal, open protocol for AI-assisted matching between people, projects, and organizations — across ecosystems, platforms, and federated networks.

The Federated Alignment API (FA-API) is a lightweight, extensible specification for expressing and discovering alignment objects — such as job posts, project needs, funding offers, skillsets, or collaboration intents — in a standardized format. Designed to support interoperability between apps, agents, and humans, FA-API connects distributed graphs of “who needs what” and “who offers what,” enabling scalable alignment across use cases.

Core features
✅ Shared alignment object schema (needs / offers / archetypes / skills)
✅ Cross-platform identity via DIDs (e.g. BlueSky, wallets, ActivityPub)
✅ Consent-aware metadata (public, private, consent_required)
✅ Modular match algorithms (rules, vectors, LLMs)
✅ Works with private or public graph stores
✅ Zero lock-in: anyone can implement, fork, or extend

Use cases already in development
🐠 Ocean regeneration (Your Devocean)
👥 AI-driven hiring (Ada Recruitment)

Use cases considered
🧙 Influencer–brand matching
🧬 Funder–founder graph alignment
🏕️ Retreat & regenerative community matching

This is not a platform. It's a contract.
Anyone can build vertical apps that speak FA-API. The protocol empowers decentralized collaboration, not central ownership.

# Glossary
Entity          = Persistent actor (person, corporation, DAO, AI agent)
AlignmentObject = Time-bounded need/offer published by an Entity
Edge            = Relation between Entity ↔ AlignmentObject or Entity ↔ Entity
DID             = Self-sovereign identifier (AT-Proto, DID:Key, etc.)
public          = Boolean: may be re-broadcast / cached by any server
consent         = explicit | implicit | absent     (GDPR art.6 mapping)
path            = Ontology address  (/alignment/<vertical>/<...leaf>)

### 🔥 Why This Protocol Exists

| Pain Point                             | Current Workaround                                                       | Why It’s Broken                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fragmented “need/offer” data (jobs, grants, ESG gigs, talent, carbon credits…) | Thousands of niche SaaS tools, spreadsheets, Discords, emails             | Data silos, no universal search, and everyone rebuilds the same match engine    |
| Incompatible schemas                   | Each platform invents its own JSON (if any)                               | Integrations are brittle, require point-to-point ETL                            |
| Consent & privacy complexity           | Ad-hoc Terms of Service, email opt-ins, duplicative GDPR implementations  | Third parties can't reliably know if sharing data is legal                      |
| Cost of deep AI matching               | Every org builds embeddings or calls GPT independently                    | Redundant compute costs; small orgs get priced out                              |
| No canonical IDs                       | Email ≠ LinkedIn ≠ wallet ≠ Discord ≠ DID                                 | Cross-platform identity mapping is manual, fragmented, and error-prone          |
